# Go Run Version

The main package contains it's state in the git tree statically. Meaning, I described statically in the source where in the tree it would be. This might be helpful to `go run` or `go get` to see which version actually was run or pulled. So far this repo hasn't been set up with go.mod intentionally, this can be another branch in the future if needed.

Current overview - remember, the last commit on branch master will always be missing ;)
